Write a python program to input differtn size of n, measures its execution time and plot complexity using python matplotlib library.

I  have used linspace function, it  is in-built in Python’s NumPy library. It is used to create an evenly spaced sequence in a specified interval.

Linear time complexity O(n) means that the algorithms take proportionally longer to complete as the input grows.

An algorithm is said to run in quadratic time if the running time of the two loops is proportional to the square of n. When n doubles, the running time increases by n * n. 
Running time of O(n), grows more slowly than a running time of O(n^2).

An algorithm is said to run in cubic time if the running time of the three loops is proportional to the cube of n. When n triples, the running time increases by n * n * n. 
Running time of O(n^2) grows more slowly than a running time of Θ(n^3).

Time Complexity said as logarithomic O(log n), if the loop variables is divided / multiplied by a constant amount. log(n) is smaller than n hence algorithm of complexity O(log(n)) is better. 
Since it will be much faster. O(logn) means that the algorithm's maximum running time is proportional to the logarithm of the input size.
Therefore, O(logn) is tighter than O(n) and is also better in terms of algorithms analysis.

Logarithms grow more slowly than polynomials. That is, O(log(n))grows more slowly than O(n^k)for any positive constant k.
